Abstraction

Modeling our objects (data) to a real object.  
Designing by refining.

How to achieve abstraction?
* Subclassing
* Encapsulation
* Code interacts with an object with a well defined, yet simple, 'interface' (functions/methods/APIs) to interact and manage,
  potentially complex details, .. properties, methods, and class attributes.
